There's a few links that are either outright dead with no context, or don't seem to exist.
- [Experimental Trial 1-3 Pt 1 - Yasuhiro, 19 (???)](https://old.reddit.com/r/DanganRoleplay/comments/8yvki5/comment/e2ev0wu) is a missing Yasuhiro Hagakure sprite, but I can't track what it might have even been -- Hagakure only has 18 sprites (0 indexed), so no clue about this one.
- There's a few Discord uploads from the old Class Trial Chat Discord channel hosted on DanganDiscord, which has since been deleted (ID 169347820619300866, created on 2016-04-12T07:27:46.766Z) 
	- [Class Trial XVII Meta - One-Upmanship](https://old.reddit.com/r/DanganRoleplay/comments/4s40ct/comment/d56bye3) is a file named [oneupmanship.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/169347820619300866/201460135607009282/oneupmanship.png), uploaded on 2016-07-09T22:10:39.277Z. (*May* be [this image posted by cwolfcommander in the old #danganroleplay channel?](https://i.imgur.com/e0ZU1LR.jpg))
	- [Class Trial XXI Meta - Flame War](https://old.reddit.com/r/DanganRoleplay/comments/4xrp2y/comment/d6iasv5) is a file named [flame-war.gif](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/169347820619300866/203761005694681088/flame-war.gif), uploaded on 2016-07-16T06:33:29.454Z.
	- [Class Trial XXIV Pt 6 - Kyoko, Cham-P](https://old.reddit.com/r/DanganRoleplay/comments/51fkku/comment/d7bswap) is a file named [kyoko-cham-p.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/169347820619300866/222794350093008896/kyoko-cham-p.png), uploaded on 2016-09-06T19:05:12.381Z.
	- [Class Trial 27 Preview 3 - Hiyoko (?)](https://old.reddit.com/r/DanganRoleplay/comments/53u641/comment/d7w8m1t) is a file named [15.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/169347820619300866/228231920448700417/15.png), uploaded on 2016-09-21T19:12:10.179Z. This one I have a replacement for, because the user was playing as Hiyoko earlier and her 15th sprite does match the text.
	- [Class Trial XXIX Preview II - Gundham, Dark Doves](https://old.reddit.com/r/DanganRoleplay/comments/55j7jp/comment/d8chc9h) is a file named [Four_dark_doves.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/169347820619300866/232576021453340672/Four_dark_doves.png), uploaded on 2016-10-03T18:54:04.568Z.
	- [Class Trial XXIX Preview II - Byakuya, Dark Doves](https://old.reddit.com/r/DanganRoleplay/comments/55j7jp/trial_xxix_preview_ii_the_murder_of_mahiru/d8chgto/) is a filed named [Dark_doves_byakuya.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/169347820619300866/232577437777657858/Dark_doves_byakuya.png), uploaded on 2016-10-03T18:59:42.246Z.
- Just about every puu.sh link (all 331 of them) is going to be unrecoverable. We may be able to recreate these sprites with context clues, but stay tuned for that.
