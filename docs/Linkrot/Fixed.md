I'm not going to link every single url and what replaced them, but I will put some notable mentions in here --
- [Experimental Trial 11 Pt 6 - Komaru, 19](https://old.reddit.com/r/DanganRoleplay/comments/ic5crl/comment/g2101lk) is a Tumblr link that is still up! But an erroneous 'C' was inserted into the url (bb119449468377b593559***C***8791dfeccd8). Searching the last part of the url produced a [gist posted by Mako](https://gist.github.com/makosear/ecf84668a916605a4e5fa97c7682fe74) that contained the corrected link.
- [Class Trial XI Conclusion - Monokuma, 13](https://old.reddit.com/r/DanganRoleplay/comments/4e7qzi/comment/d1xtdpn) is a Tumblr link that is also still up! Somehow, an encoded newline was inserted (cea199aab53a7ec850d63fcc5fcbc29***%0A***c)
- [Class Trial X Pt 3 - Hiyoko, 16](https://old.reddit.com/r/DanganRoleplay/comments/4cvpzf/comment/d1m0gha) is yet another Tumblr link with an extra character inserted. This one was a 'g' (91c37d1bab6945**g**73bce04ae94fb39d17) that was recovered thanks to someone else using that link on an indexed forum! Thanks forums!
- [Class Trial 6 Pt 2 - Kiyotaka, 17](https://old.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/45l29m/comment/czyjl3i) is an image from Hatena Fotolife, which is (also) still up! However, between the comment being posted 7(!) years ago and today, the website now requires HTTPS to be used, but doesn't redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, instead giving a 403 error. This is incidentally fixed by our auto HTTPS normalisation.
- [Class Trial XV Pt 7 - Ibuki, Unknown](https://old.reddit.com/r/DanganRoleplay/comments/4nztbq/comment/d48ggdz) is a completely dead link. No references I could find to it anywhere. *But*, the comment says "Don't worry, *Chiaki-chan*! ... playing the raddest damn triangle ... *like before!*", and Chiaki does play a triangle in an event in DR2, so I've replaced with a link on the wiki for the [Toy Camera Event](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/danganronpa/images/7/74/Danganronpa_2_CG_-_Toy_Camera_Event_(1).png) from DR2-3.
